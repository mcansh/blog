Firstly, I’d like to apolagize for the lack and timing of these posts. I’ve been
busy at work and unfortunately haven’t had the time to write them 😭.

A Javascript object is a standalone entity, with properties and types associated
with it. Object properties are basically the same as javascript variables except
for they’re attached to objects.

You define a propterty by defining it a value, for example:

```javascript
const myCar = new Object();
myCar.make = 'Ford';
```

If you define a property but {"don't"} give it a value it becomes undefined, not
null. e.g: myCar.color; would return undefined.

To get an item out of an object you can test to see if it has that property, for
example, on a project at work, we used this to get a rule's name out of the
object

```javascript
// The Rule itself
const rule = {
  active: true,
  conditions: [
    {
      time: {
        day: [1, 2, 3, 4],
        at: '17:30',
      },
    },
  ],
  uuid: 'some-rule-uuid',
  consequences: {
    devices: {
      '66d5e0ed-5e88-4353-9dd9-318cad3676f9': {
        'thermostat_setpoint.heat.set': {
          value: 77,
        },
        'thermostat_setpoint.cool.set': {
          value: 80,
        },
      },
    },
  },
  type: 'rule',
  priority: 1,
  name: 'test rule',
};
```

You can also do if else statements with objects:

```javascript
if (cond) var x = { greeting: 'howdy' };
```

You can even have an object inside another object:

```javascript
const myCar = {
  color: 'red',
  wheels: 4,
  engine: {
    cylinders: 4,
    size: 2.2,
  },
};
```

Alternatively you can make an object with a constructor function:

```javascript
function Car(make, model, year) {
  this.make = make;
  this.model = model;
  this.year = year;
}

const myCar = new Car('Volvo', 'S40', 2005);
```
