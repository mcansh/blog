Ahhh, this question. Ready? Good, letâ€™s go.

Learning to code is like learning anything in life, it takes practice. At the beginning you may feel uncomfortable or like you donâ€™t think you know what youâ€™re doing. Thatâ€™s actually somewhat of a good thing. As long as you keep practicing youâ€™ll become great. Practice makes perfect. Iâ€™m sure you couldnâ€™t ride a bike on the first attempt either, same thing with coding. After a bit of practice you could ride that bike no problem, same concept applies here. Keep on hacking.

Yeah, I know, another short post *sigh*. Who knows maybe Iâ€™ll keep this blogging thing up and going and get better. *gasp* The same process can be made with coding and blogging ğŸ˜±.
