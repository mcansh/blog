Ahhh, this question. Ready? Good, let’s go.

Learning to code is like learning anything in life, it takes practice. At the
beginning you may feel uncomfortable or like you don’t think you know what
you’re doing. That’s actually somewhat of a good thing. As long as you keep
practicing you’ll become great. Practice makes perfect. I’m sure you couldn’t
ride a bike on the first attempt either, same thing with coding. After a bit of
practice you could ride that bike no problem, same concept applies here. Keep on
hacking.

Yeah, I know, another short post _sigh_. Who knows maybe I’ll keep this blogging
thing up and going and get better. _gasp_ The same process can be made with
coding and blogging 😱.
