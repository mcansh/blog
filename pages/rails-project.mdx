You're Probably wondering where that Rails project is eh?

Well... the project has been <a href="https://github.com/mcansh/rails-project" target="_blank" rel="noopener external nofollow">done</a> for a bit now but I never wrote a post about it.

Just like my [Sinatra Project](https://mcansh.blog/sinatra-project), I made a CRUD todo app, which allows you to signup for an account with your email or using your GitHub account. After signing up, you can make a new list, make new tasks, edit your list, delete your list, and delete your tasks. If you try accessing a list which you haven't made, you'll be redirected back to the previous page and see an error.

export default ({ children }) => <Post meta={meta}>{children}</Post>
