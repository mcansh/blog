You're Probably wondering where that Rails project is eh?

Well... the project has been [done](https://github.com/mcansh/rails-project) for
a bit now but I never wrote a post about it.

Just like my [Sinatra Project](/sinatra-project), I made a CRUD todo app, which
allows you to signup for an account with your email or using your GitHub
account. After signing up, you can make a new list, make new tasks, edit your
list, delete your list, and delete your tasks. If you try accessing a list which
you haven't made, you'll be redirected back to the previous page and see an
error.

export default ({ children }) => <Post meta={meta}>{children}</Post>;
