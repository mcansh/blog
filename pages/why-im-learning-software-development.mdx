This is my first attempt at blogging, so I am sorry that this is ~7 days late.
To be 100% honest with you, I don’t know my true reason for wanting to learn
software development. Something about seeing what you made by typing away on a
keyboard brings a warm fuzzy sensation to me. I took a web development class in
high school, that was about 3 years ago, and I’ve been hooked ever since. I make
a website for anything I possibly can.

This blogging thing is getting easier even after writing one paragraph, maybe I
can do this. I didn’t learn to code to make money, though that is a nice outcome
from it, I did it because it’s fucking awesome to be able to see something you
made just a short time ago. Coding teaches you patience and a knowledgable way
to find solutions. You will get stuck, but you will get past what was holding
you back.

This was a short one I know, hopefully the next one will make up for it.
