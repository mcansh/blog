Firstly, Iâ€™d like to apolagize for the lack and timing of these posts. Iâ€™ve been busy at work and unfortunately havenâ€™t had the time to write them ðŸ˜­.

A Javascript object is a standalone entity, with properties and types associated with it. Object properties are basically the same as javascript variables except for theyâ€™re attached to objects.

You define a propterty by defining it a value, for example:

<Code language="javascript">{`
const myCar = new Object();
myCar.make = "Ford";
`}</Code>

If you define a property but {"don't"} give it a value it becomes undefined, not null. e.g: myCar.color; would return undefined.

To get an item out of an object you can test to see if it has that property, for example, on a project at work, we used this to get a rule's name out of the object

<Code language="javascript">{`
// The Rule itself
const rule = {
  "active": true,
  "conditions": [
    {
      "time": {
        "day": [1,2,3,4],
        "at": "17:30"
      }
    }
  ],
  "uuid": "some-rule-uuid",
  "consequences": {
    "devices": {
      "66d5e0ed-5e88-4353-9dd9-318cad3676f9": {
        "thermostat_setpoint.heat.set": {
          "value": 77
        },
        "thermostat_setpoint.cool.set": {
          "value": 80
        }
      }
    }
  },
  "type":"rule",
  "priority":1,
  "name":"test rule"
};
`}</Code>

You can also do if else statements with objects:

<Code language="javascript">{`
if (cond) var x = { greeting: 'howdy' };
`}</Code>

You can even have an object inside another object:

<Code language="javascript">{`
const myCar = {
  color: "red",
  wheels: 4,
  engine: {
    cylinders: 4,
    size: 2.2
  }
};
`}</Code>

Alternatively you can make an object with a constructor function:

<Code language="javascript">{`
function Car(make, model, year) {
  this.make = make;
  this.model = model;
  this.year = year;
}\n
const myCar = new Car("Volvo", "S40", 2005);
`}</Code>

export default ({ children }) => <Post meta={meta}>{children}</Post>
