6 months?! Yes, six months.. My procrastination has hit an all time high and my motivation, an all time low. Work has been crazy busy, I'm actually working on a really cool web app built with react right now to give you insights on your smart home. If only I could just turn that in for this am I right lol. Anyways enough excuses, September is the 2 year mark "being" at learn, and honestly, that's way to long in my opinion to be in attendance at this bootcamp, even working 30-40 hours a week during all of it, I should have been able to get ewverything done, not just for this project, but for all the coursework and other projects in under 6 months. I screwed up. I think a lot of it came down to not having actual due dates for things, so I never scheduled anything related to the subject. Anyways, I'm hoping to have the final project out in a couple weeks, please ask me about it non-stop on <a href="https://twitter.com/loganmcansh" target="_blank" rel="noopener external nofollow">twitter</a> so I actually act on it and finish it! 🤙
