        <P>The most important thing to know about Rack and the internet is knowing how the internet works. First you have <code>HEAD</code>, <code>GET</code>, <code>POST</code>, <code>PUT</code>, <code>DELETE</code>, <code>TRACE</code>, <code>OPTIONS</code>, <code>CONNECT</code>, and <code>PATCH</code> requests. ðŸ¤” huh? Letâ€™s run through them.</P>

        <P><code>GET</code> requests get a resource. <code>HEAD</code> requests are <code>GET</code> requests without the body of them. <code>POST</code> requests will submit data. <code>PUT</code> will upload data. <code>DELETE</code> will, well, delete a resource. <code>TRACE</code> requests will return the recieved request. <code>OPTIONS</code> will return the HTTP methods that your server supports. <code>CONNECT</code> converts the request to a TCP/IP tunnel, ususally used for SSL. <code>PATCH</code> requests are used for partial modifications to a resource.</P>

        <P>You can see what type of requests a website is using by looking in the network tab in Dev Tools.</P>

        <P>Now onto Rack itself. Rack is a Ruby gem that provides a minimal interface that goes between a server that supports Ruby and Ruby Frameworks.</P>

        <P>To use Rack you must first make a call to a class #call. All this needs to do is return a response that contains status codes, headers, and the body. That can be done with a <code>Rack::Response</code> object:</P>

        <Code>{`
    # call.rb

    class Application
      def call(env)
        resp = Rack::Response.new
        resp.write "Hello, World"
        resp.finish
      end
    end
        `}</Code>


        <P>That will run whenever a request is received but you still need to set up a HTTP serve to receive that request. Using config.ru</P>

        <Code>{`
    # config.ru

    require_relative "./application.rb"
    run Application.new
        `}</Code>

        <P>Now running <code>rackup config.ru</code> will start up your application.</P>
