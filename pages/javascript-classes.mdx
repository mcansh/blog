The key concept in class variables and methods is how to define them. Classes
are realistically just “special functions”. To define a class, you use the
keyword class followed by the name you want to give it.

```javascript
class myClass {
  constructor(height, width) {
    this.height = height;
    this.width = width;
  }
}
```

When you’re defining classes make sure they are hoisted or your code will throw
errors like

```javascript
var p = new myClass(); // ReferenceError
class myClass {}
```

It should be known that the content of a class declaration is executed in strict
mode.

export default ({ children }) => <Post meta={meta}>{children}</Post>;
