Ruby. There's times I absolutely hate it, and there's times I'm cool with it.
This was actualy one of the times I enjoyed it. For my
[Ruby CLI project](https://github.com/mcansh/ruby-reddit-cli-app) I decided to
scrape [r/ruby](https://reddit.com/r/ruby), and reddit made it super easy to get
all the info. Maybe in an upcoming update I'll add the ability to pass in a
subreddit as a parameter so it'll be more versatile, but for now its just
r/ruby. The scraping itself is done with Nokogiri inside the
[scraper class](https://github.com/mcansh/ruby-reddit-cli-app/blob/master/lib/reddit/scraper.rb).

Check it out on [github](https://github.com/mcansh/ruby-reddit-cli-app) or on
[rubygems](https://rubygems.org/gems/reddit-ruby)

**Update:** as of
[1.0.8](https://github.com/mcansh/ruby-reddit-cli-app/releases/tag/1.0.8), it
supports any public subreddit.
