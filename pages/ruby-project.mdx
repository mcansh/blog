Ruby. There's times I absolutely hate it, and there's times I'm cool with it. This was actualy one of the times I enjoyed it. For my [Ruby CLI project](https://github.com/mcansh/ruby-reddit-cli-app) I decided to scrape [r/ruby](https://reddit.com/r/ruby), and reddit made it super easy to get all the info. Maybe in an upcoming update I'll add the ability to pass in a subreddit as a parameter so it'll be more versatile, but for now its just r/ruby. The scraping itself is done with Nokogiri inside the [scraper class](https://github.com/mcansh/ruby-reddit-cli-app/blob/master/lib/reddit/scraper.rb).

Check it out on [github](https://github.com/mcansh/ruby-reddit-cli-app) or on [rubygems](https://rubygems.org/gems/reddit-ruby)

__Update:__ as of <a href="https://github.com/mcansh/ruby-reddit-cli-app/releases/tag/1.0.8" target="_blank" rel="noopener external nofollow">1.0.8</a>, it supports any public subreddit.
