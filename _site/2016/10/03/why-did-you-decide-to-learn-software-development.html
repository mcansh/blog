        <p>This is my first attempt at blogging, so I am sorry that this is ~7 days late. To be 100% honest with you, I don’t know my true reason for wanting to learn software development. Something about seeing what you made by typing away on a keyboard brings a warm fuzzy sensation to me. I took a web development class in high school, that was about 3 years ago, and I’ve been hooked ever since. I make a website for anything I possibly can.</p>

<p>This blogging thing is getting easier even after writing one paragraph, maybe I can do this. I didn’t learn to code to make money, though that is a nice outcome from it, I did it because it’s fucking awesome to be able to see something you made just a short time ago. Coding teaches you patience and a knowledgable way to find solutions. You will get stuck, but you will get past what was holding you back.</p>

<p>This was a short one I know, hopefully the next one will make up for it.</p>
